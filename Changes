Revision history for Perl extension ExtUtils::Constant.

	Copy the module and test from bleadperl
        Find and fix a bug when there is only 1 item of a given length, but
        it has the "check utf8 flag" set. Regression test 52 now tests this.

        More aggressive switch code:
        a: If the last character was used as the switch target, no need to
           check it again with memEQ (ie memcmp)
        b: If the first character is used as the switch target, no need to
           check it again with memEQ  (this does need C code to move the
           pointer target, so last character is preferred)
        c: Three character strings are now done as 2 explicit character
           comparisons after the switch, rather than memEQ. It may be worth
           extending this to four character strings.
        Refactor the regression test code to allow multiple test extensions
        to be built. This way the various possibilities in the switch code can
        easily be tested.
        The "more aggressive" switch code shrinks bleadperl's extensions by a
        grand total of 648(ish) bytes. Amazing! (well, every little helps)
        Will now install into the core for perl 5.8.0 or later (as it's a core
        module from 5.7.2ish)
